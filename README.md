## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project predicts the **selling price of used cars** based on key features such as brand, year, mileage, fuel type, and city.  
It includes:
- Data cleaning and exploratory analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- An **interactive dashboard** (built using Power BI) for price visualization and prediction
- A short demo video showing the dashboard in action

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **Source:** [Add your dataset source or link]
- **Rows:** [Number of rows]
- **Columns:** [Main columns like year, kms_run, fuel_type, selling_price, etc.]
- **Target:** `selling_price`

## ðŸ§  Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   Cleaned data, handled missing values, created new features like `age` and `kms_per_year`.
2. **EDA:**  
   Visualized relationships between price, fuel type, brand, and kilometers.
3. **Modeling:**  
   Trained multiple ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost) and compared performance.
4. **Evaluation:**  
   Reported metrics: RMSE, MAE, RÂ².
5. **Dashboard:**  
   Interactive dashboard for insights and on-the-fly predictions.
